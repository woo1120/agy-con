# GJC Dogfood Operator Workflow

Use GJC first for coding, review, planning, and follow-up sessions. Treat OMX as a fallback only when GJC is unavailable, broken, or missing a required capability.

## Locate and Launch GJC

- **Installed CLI**: run `command -v gjc` and then launch with `gjc --tmux`.
- **Repository checkout**: from the gajae-code repo, prefer `bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts --tmux` when testing source changes before install.
- **Worktree isolation**: for branch-specific work, launch from or point at the branch worktree with `gjc --tmux --worktree <path>`.
- **Name sessions explicitly** with the project and issue, for example `gajae-code-93-dogfood-skill`, so tmux panes, logs, and exports remain traceable.

## Start the Session

1. Put git operations inside the GJC session: fetch, branch/worktree setup, focused commits, pushes, and PR creation should be visible in-session.
2. Submit the initial prompt with the issue URL, target branch, acceptance criteria, verification limits, and any existing plan/spec link.
3. Verify the prompt was accepted: the TUI should show the user prompt, an active assistant turn, or a tool/action request. If the session silently idles, resend once with a shorter prompt and capture the failure.
4. Verify working state before leaving the session unattended: confirm the target cwd/worktree, branch, and issue scope are visible in the transcript or command output.

## During Work

- Keep session names and branch names issue-scoped.
- Prefer GJC workflow skills only when they fit:
  - `deep-interview` for unclear requirements
  - `ralplan` for planning
  - `ultragoal` for durable ledgers
  - `team` for coordinated tmux execution
- Keep evidence in the session: issue reads, focused tests/checks, screenshots only when visual behavior matters, and PR URLs.
- When GJC is weaker than OMX, finish the urgent work with the smallest safe fallback and file a gajae-code follow-up issue with the missing capability, exact command/session context, expected behavior, and evidence.

## Fallback Policy

Use OMX or another operator path **only** when:

- `gjc` cannot be located or launched after checking installed and repo-local commands;
- authentication, model routing, tmux, or prompt submission is broken;
- GJC lacks a required capability that OMX already has;
- an urgent production/review deadline would be missed by debugging GJC first.

Record the fallback reason and create or link the gajae-code issue that would make GJC sufficient next time.

## Evidence Checklist

Report:

- project, issue, branch/worktree, and session name;
- whether GJC was installed or repo-local;
- prompt acceptance and working-state evidence;
- git operations performed in-session;
- focused verification commands and results;
- PR/issue URLs;
- follow-up gajae-code issues for any GJC gap or fallback.
